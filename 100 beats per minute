time keeping:

100 beats per minute
30 frames a second

means 1800 frames a minute

18 frames a beat(3/5)

72 frames a measure

or 2 seconds and 12 frames per measure(2.4 seconds)


and this section occurs for 1 minute and 12 seconds 

or

72 seconds 

or 

120 beats

240 beats actually because we're doing 8/8 instead of 4/4

240/8= 40*6/8 = 30 measures 

I have 11 days 

so do 3 measures a day? 

just 24 beats! 

and I want to know what everyone is doing on each beat.
